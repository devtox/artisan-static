SQLite is a relational database management system (RDBMS), similar to MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, and Microsoft SQL Server. However, unlike these other database systems, SQLite is not a client-server database engine. Instead, it is embedded into the application that accesses the database. This makes SQLite suitable for use in mobile applications, web browsers, and general purpose programming languages.

SQLite was first released in 2000 and has since become one of the most widely used database systems in the world. As of 2019, SQLite is installed on more than 1 billion devices worldwide. The source code for SQLite is in the public domain and can be used for any purpose without restrictions.

SQLite supports standard relational database features such as tables, indexes, transactions, and constraints. It also supports some non-standard features such as triggers and foreign key constraints.

## SQL language

SQL is a language used to manage databases. It stands for Structured Query Language and can be pronounced as "sequel" or "S-Q-L." SQL is used to query, insert, update, and delete data from a database. In addition, it can be used to create views, indexes, and stored procedures. SQL is not case sensitive, meaning that you can use upper or lower case letters interchangeably. However, most people prefer to use all uppercase letters when writing SQL code.


## sqlite3

The Python standard library includes a module called sqlite3 which allows developers to easily interact with stored data using Python objects and syntax.  SQLite is a lightweight disk-based database which doesn't require a separate server process and allows accessing the database using a nonstandard variant of the SQL query language.
